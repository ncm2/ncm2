## Introduction

NCM2, formerly known as
[nvim-completion-manager](https://github.com/roxma/nvim-completion-manager),
is a slim, fast and hackable completion framework for neovim.

Main features:

1. Fast and asynchronous completion support, with vimscript friendly API.
2. Smart on files with different languages, for example, css/javascript
   completion in html style/script tag.
3. Function parameter expansion support using
   [ncm2-snippet](https://github.com/topics/ncm2-snippet) plugins.
4. [Language server protocol plugin
   integration](https://github.com/ncm2/ncm2/wiki).

Read [our wiki page](https://github.com/ncm2/ncm2/wiki) for a list of
extensions and programming languages support for NCM2.

## Requirements

- `:echo has("nvim-0.2.2")` prints 1. Older versions has not been tested
- `:echo has("python3")` prints 1
- Plugin [nvim-yarp](https://github.com/roxma/nvim-yarp)

For vim8 user, read the [nvim-yarp](https://github.com/roxma/nvim-yarp)
README. **Note that vim8 support is simply a bonus. It's not the goal of
NCM2.**

## Install

```vim
    " assuming you're using vim-plug: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug
    Plug 'ncm2/ncm2'
    Plug 'roxma/nvim-yarp'

    " enable ncm2 for all buffers
    autocmd BufEnter * call ncm2#enable_for_buffer()

    " IMPORTANT: :help Ncm2PopupOpen for more information
    set completeopt=noinsert,menuone,noselect

    " NOTE: you need to install completion sources to get completions. Check
    " our wiki page for a list of sources: https://github.com/ncm2/ncm2/wiki
    Plug 'ncm2/ncm2-bufword'
    Plug 'ncm2/ncm2-tmux'
    Plug 'ncm2/ncm2-path'
```

## Optional Vimrc Tips

```vim
    " suppress the annoying 'match x of y', 'The only match' and 'Pattern not
    " found' messages
    set shortmess+=c

    " CTRL-C doesn't trigger the InsertLeave autocmd . map to <ESC> instead.
    inoremap <c-c> <ESC>

    " When the <Enter> key is pressed while the popup menu is visible, it only
    " hides the menu. Use this mapping to close the menu and also start a new
    " line.
    inoremap <expr> <CR> (pumvisible() ? "\<c-y>\<cr>" : "\<CR>")

    " Use <TAB> to select the popup menu:
    inoremap <expr> <Tab> pumvisible() ? "\<C-n>" : "\<Tab>"
    inoremap <expr> <S-Tab> pumvisible() ? "\<C-p>" : "\<S-Tab>"

    " wrap existing omnifunc
    " Note that omnifunc does not run in background and may probably block the
    " editor. If you don't want to be blocked by omnifunc too often, you could
    " add 180ms delay before the omni wrapper:
    "  'on_complete': ['ncm2#on_complete#delay', 180,
    "               \ 'ncm2#on_complete#omni', 'csscomplete#CompleteCSS'],
    au User Ncm2Plugin call ncm2#register_source({
            \ 'name' : 'css',
            \ 'priority': 9, 
            \ 'subscope_enable': 1,
            \ 'scope': ['css','scss'],
            \ 'mark': 'css',
            \ 'word_pattern': '[\w\-]+',
            \ 'complete_pattern': ':\s*',
            \ 'on_complete': ['ncm2#on_complete#omni', 'csscomplete#CompleteCSS'],
            \ })
```

## How Do I write Ncm2 Source?

One important step is to understand how and when completion gets triggered.
Read `:help ncm2#register_source` carefully. There's a small interactive
script in the doc. It is helpful for both understanding and debugging.

In case you don't know what tool you should use for async support. Here are
some options available:

- `:help jobstart()`
- [python remote plugin
  example](https://github.com/jacobsimpson/nvim-example-python-plugin)
- I myself prefer to use [nvim-yarp](https://github.com/roxma/nvim-yarp)
    - Read [ncm2/ncm2-bufword](https://github.com/ncm2/ncm2-bufword) for
        example
